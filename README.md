# Emotion-Detection-based-on-Audio
This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of detecting emotions from audio data, of female voices, rejecting all other non-female voices. The model utilizes features extracted from audio clips to classify emotions into predefined categories.

Setup Instructions:

1. Downloading Dataset and files

Download the repository and unzip it.
Download the dataset from the link given below: 
"https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ejlok1/toronto-emotional-speech-set-tess"
And keep it in the same folder as of all other files.

2. Install Dependencies

Ensure you have Python 3.x and the required libraries installed as per given in requirements.txt file.

3. Running the Model

Jupyter Notebook: Open and run the emotion-detection-based-on-voice.ipynb and 'gender-detection-based-on-voice.ipynb' notebook. 

Kaggle Kernel: 
Upload the notebook and dataset to your Kaggle account.
Ensure the paths in the notebook match the dataset location on Kaggle.
Run the notebook directly on the Kaggle platform.

4. Using GUI 
Use gui.py file to upload and record audio thereafter predicting the emotion.
